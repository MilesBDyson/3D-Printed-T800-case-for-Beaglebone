the files were originally downloaded from somewhere on Thingiverse. I used blender to modify them for the needs of mounting a Beaglebone Black inside the head, there are 3 holse for user leds in each temple along with holse for the eyes, the 4 hols between the top and middle are for pins so you can remove the top allowing access to the beaglebone, as for the bolt patern of the beaglebone i simply marked the holes by holding the Beaglebone in place and then installing 3/8 inch plastic standoffs, after drilling the holes and dry fitting to be sure the standoffs fit nicely (had to open up a few of them) i added a liberal amount of moddle glue to them then installed, allowing several hours for the glue to dry before removing the screws and the Beaglebone to apply more glue.
